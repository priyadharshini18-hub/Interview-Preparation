Prims Minimum Spanning Tree

Given : Graph
Output : Tree with all vertices + minimum weight of edges

Start from any node
Create a visited set to store all the explored nodes
Create a PQ (weight, node, parent)
MST_Weight = 0
Add starting node to PQ (0, start, -1)

while PQ and len(visited) < n :
    POP top of PQ (gives edge with shortest weight)
    Check if top in visited -> yes : continue
    Add top to visited
    MST_Weight = MST_Weight + top weight
    Add all the connected edges to PQ

Output = MST_Weight
