-- Heap implementation using Array --

-- MAX Heap --

Left child -> 2*i + 1
Right child -> 2*i + 2

Creation :

Keep appending the new values into the array
Iterate from bottom to top (only for the internal nodes)
    Start from n//2-1 till top in reverse
    Call Heapify

Heapify :

Find the left and right children index
Compare parent with its left and right children
    If left or right child is greater -> SWAP with parent
Repeat until the top
